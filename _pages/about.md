I'm a Research Engineer at the [Ontology Engineering Group](https://oeg.fi.upm.es/), Universidad Politécnica de Madrid, where I develop explainable AI systems that make Large Language Models transparent, reliable, and genuinely useful for domain experts. With over two years of experience building LLM-based systems for specialized applications, my research focuses on understanding the capabilities and limitations of AI in knowledge-intensive fields.

Through projects spanning solar chemistry, ontology engineering, and software understanding, I've witnessed both the remarkable potential and critical limitations of current AI systems. My work aims to bridge this gap by developing methodologies that serve as genuine collaborators for domain experts who require not just answers, but understanding of the reasoning process.

## Research Interests

My research focuses on three core areas:

**Domain-Adaptive AI Systems**: Developing LLM applications that serve as trustworthy collaborators in knowledge-intensive fields — from solar chemistry and ontology engineering to software understanding — with emphasis on explainability and user-centered design.

**Graph Learning Methodology**: Exploring graph neural network applications across diverse domains — graph similarity search, node/link prediction, and adapting GNN architectures for real-world structured data problems.

**LLM Evaluation & Benchmarking**: Constructing comprehensive evaluation frameworks that measure not just accuracy, but explanation quality, scientific integrity, and real-world usability across diverse tasks and domains.

## Current Projects

### SolarChem: RAG Pipeline for Solar Chemistry
I designed and deployed a production-ready LLM-based QA pipeline helping solar chemistry experts review experimental settings from 700+ academic papers. The system implements multiple information retrieval strategies (semantic chunking, re-ranking) and RAG methods (NaiveRAG, FactRAG, GraphRAG). I constructed a benchmark with 500+ expert annotations from 100 papers for comprehensive strategy evaluation.

### INESData: LLMs for Ontology Engineering
This project focuses on integrating LLMs with ontology engineering tasks, resulting in a publication at ISWC'24. I designed comprehensive benchmarks for tasks including text2triples, triples2ontology, query generation, and ontology indexing, constructing 4 gold-standard ontologies with multi-perspective evaluation metrics (semantic, lexical, hierarchical).

### SoftSim: Graph Neural Networks for Software Understanding
I constructed a novel dataset of 6,000+ GitHub repositories in graph, tree, and linear structures for ML/GNN training. The project enables various downstream tasks including software similarity and classification with metadata-driven learning, implementing and evaluating SOTA GNN models (SimGNN, GMN, GCN) with graph pooling architectures.
